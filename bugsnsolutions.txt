# Error:
    Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined
    Found in Navbar.js
# Solution:
    Don't use curly braces when importing Nextjs items, particular those that come pre installed such as "Link". This is due to default exports not
    working well with default auto-imports.
    Change:
    import {Link} from "next/link" to -> import Link from "next/link"

# Error:
    Module parse failed: Unexpected character '' (1:0)
    You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders

    Trouble importing a video file, when tried to link it through public folder got gray box that didn't play video.
    Tried importing through html <Video><source src={require("path/to/video.mp4")} /></Video>, got error.
    Tried importing from top, still didn't work.

# Solution
    Had to add webpack that could process video. Altered config file and downloaded file loader
